The time-measure complement|A time-measure complement placed after a verb is employed to show the duration of an action or a state, e.g.\n他休息了一天\n我每天锻炼一个小时\n我们已经分别十年了.\n\nA verb with an object is generally repeated, and the verb may be followed at its second appearance by a time-measure complement if the sentence contains one.\n我们等他等了二十分钟\n她打电话打了一刻钟\n哥哥学英语学了两年\n\nIf the object is a non-personal pronoun, the time-measure complement (sometimes with "的") may also be put between the verb and its object.\n我念了四个分钟语法\n踏上三小时的口语课\n古波学了三年的中文\n我听一刻钟新闻\n\nThe object may be put before the subject of a sentence for emphasis or when the object has a very complicated structure, e.g.\n那条裙子她找了一个多小时\n见天的纸你要看一个晚上吗？\n这个很难的问题他想了两天\n\nThe former kind of word order normally does not apply to sentences containing a complicated object such as the sentences mentioned above. For example, it is wrong to say,\n她找了一个多小时的那条裙子\n\nNote that when a sentence with a time-measure complement and an aspect particle "了" after its verb, contains a modal particle "了" at the end, the idea that the action is still continuing is suggested,\n我们学习了两年的中文了 （the action "study" is still continuing).\n我们学习了两年的中文 (it doesn't say whether the action "study" is still continuing or not).
